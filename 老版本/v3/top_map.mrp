      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  35,000    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      3

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,899
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,503 out of   2,899   51%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 120 out of   2,899    4%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,276 out of   2,899   44%
    Number of unique control sets:              19
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              45 out of 202,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
